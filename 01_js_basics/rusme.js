I am a seasoned Software Development Engineer in Test [SDET] with 6 years of experience dedicated to ensuring the quality of software through both manual and automated testing. My expertise spans across JavaScript, TypeScript, Cypress, and Playwright, and I am well-versed in testing practices such as Test-Driven Development [TDD] and Behavior-Driven Development [BDD] with Cucumber. I specialize in testing across all layers, from UI to API and database, 
with a focus on creating scalable and reliable test suites that contribute to high-quality software delivery.

I’m committed to staying at the forefront of QA technologies, constantly refining processes and advocating for improved testing methodologies. I enjoy working closely with teams to bridge the gap between development and QA, fostering collaboration to craft innovative solutions. I excel in dynamic, fast-paced settings where both teamwork and quality are prioritized, and I’m motivated to make a meaningful impact by delivering top-tier products that enhance the user experience.
